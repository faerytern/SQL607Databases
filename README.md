# SQL607Databases
To manage databases stored as complete SQL queries.
  In ITC607, I am expecting to re-use several example databases and modify them to the needs of a new assignment/lab work.
  
  In an effort to use GitHub more frequently and get more fun out of it, 
  I am going to use this GitHub Repo to manage base databases in a master branch,
  and create new branches with the changes applied to base databases.
